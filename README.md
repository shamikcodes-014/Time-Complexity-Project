Developed for a college project. This project finds out the time complexity of python programs having a linear time complexity. The executable_env is to be run, and paste the program whose time complexity you want to find out in the function. After pasting, click on the file menu and click on run. The program will open a new window and will show the time as well space complexity of your program. The entire process runs with a seamless GUI making it efficient for the user to use it.

The only drawback being the programs ability to find out linear time complexities and not anyother.
